      "featureTitle": "Add a data update mechanism that can incorporate crafting database updates “from the internet”: allow each game to have one or more configurable remote data sources (HTTPS URL endpoints returning JSON). Implement backend functions to (a) fetch and validate remote data, (b) upsert it into stored game/item data, and (c) record per-game lastUpdated timestamp and update status (success/failure + message). Provide a manual “Refresh data” action callable from the frontend to trigger an update for a selected game.",
