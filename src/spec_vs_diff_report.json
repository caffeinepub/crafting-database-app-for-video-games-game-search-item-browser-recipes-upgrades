      "requirement": "Publish (promote) the currently deployed draft build as the production version, without making any code or configuration changes.",
      "reason": "The diff contains new and modified source files, so the production deployment would not be using the exact same draft artifact. Additionally, a backend migration file was added, which explicitly violates the publish-only/migration prohibition.",
